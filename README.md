# Simple Conditional Formatting in Power BI Visuals Using A Measure

This is a simple visuals project where I'm modified the blank visual slightly, to use it to accept a measure we can use to format the foreground colour of the text based on the value of another one.

To replicate locally, you can clone or fork the repo, run `npm i` or `yarn` to update dependencies, and as long as you have the Power BI Visuals SDK installed, you should be good to go.

A very simple sample workbook can be found in the [releases page](https://github.com/dm-p/powerbi-simpleConditionalFormatting/releases/tag/1.0.0), along with a compiled version (.pbiviz) of the source.
